My own version of the method described in here http://datagenetics.com/blog/november32013/index.html

You need to have the files Rami.jpg, Anne.jpg and Heart.jpg images in the same folder as the ImageMixer.py -file. They should each be black&white images with equal dimensions. The Rami.jpg and Anne.jpg -files will describe the plain images will appear by themselves, and the Heart.jpg will describe the resultant image.
Output files Output1.jpg and Output2.jpg should be printed both on a transparency or both on transparency. Overlay.jpg is for testing and shows what the intended overlay image should look like.

The assosiated .tex -file will provide printable versions of the outputted pictures.
